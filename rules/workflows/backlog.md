# Backlog Policy

The Backlog **Project Artifact** tracks future work, ideas, and non-critical issues.

## When to use

* Feature ideas not yet prioritized.
* Technical debt that doesn't break the build.
* Non-critical bugs deferred from immediate fix.

## Workflows

* **Create**: Use `workflows/add_task.md` to add items.
* **Plan**: Move items to `workflows/create_plan.md` when prioritizing.

## Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: New idea.
2. **Planned**: Scheduled in an Implementation Plan.
3. **Done**: Completed.
4. **Archived**: Won't do.
