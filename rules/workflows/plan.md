# Plan Policy

Implementation Plan **Project Artifacts** allow us to design before we code.

## When to use

* Designing complex features.
* Orchestrating multiple changes.
* Getting approval before coding.

## Workflows

* **Create**: Use `workflows/create_plan.md` to design a solution for **Backlog Items** or **Bugs**.
* **Implement**: Use `workflows/implement_feature.md` to produce **Code** from a plan.

## Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Initial design.
2. **Review**: Waiting for user approval.
3. **Approved**: Ready for implementation.
4. **Implemented**: Coding complete.
