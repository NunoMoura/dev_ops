# [Language Name] Standards

Core standards and best practices for [Language Name] development within the
DevOps framework.

## Core Principles

- **Clarity over Cleverness**: Write code that is easy for both humans and AI
- agents to understand.
- **Strong Typing**: Leverage [Language Name]'s type system to prevent runtime errors.
- **Consistent Formatting**: Use standard tooling to maintain a unified style.

## Naming Conventions

- **Files**: kebab-case or snake_case based on ecosystem norms.
- **Variables/Functions**: ecosystem standard.
- **Classes**: PascalCase.

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Error Handling**: Use idiomatic error handling (exceptions, results).
2. **Documentation**: Document public APIs using [Language Name] standard
   (docstrings, comments).
3. **Complexity**: Keep functions focused and small.

## Testing Standards

- **Unit Tests**: Required for all business logic.
- **Mocks**: Use for external dependencies.
- **Integration Tests**: Required for critical paths.

## Tooling

- **Linter**: Refer to [Language Name]-specific linter rules.
- **Formatter**: Mandatory usage on every commit.
