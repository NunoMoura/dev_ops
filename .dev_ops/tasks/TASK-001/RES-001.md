# RES-001 - Document System Architecture

## Scope

### In Scope

- Analysis of the folder structure in `extension/` and `payload/`.
- Identification of "leaf components" (logical units of functionality).
- Creation of `SPEC.md` files for each identified leaf component.
- Updating `architecture_doc.md` or equivalent if it exists.

### Out of Scope

- Documenting third-party libraries (unless they are core to the architecture).
- Documenting internal logic details (that belongs in `SPEC.md`, but I won't go too deep into *every* function).
- Changing code logic.

### Affected Components

- Root project structure
- `extension/src/*`
- `payload/*`

## Internal Research

### Identified Leaf Components

#### Extension (VS Code specific)

- **`services/agents`**: AI agent adapters (Antigravity, Cursor).
- **`services/board`**: Task board persistence and state management.
- **`services/tasks`**: Task management logic (access, presentation).
- **`services/setup`**: Project onboarding and framework installation.
- **`infrastructure`**: Workspaces (Node, VS Code) and logging.
- **`ui/board`**: React board view.
- **`ui/tasks`**: Task details and list views.
- **`vscode`**: VS Code command registration and integration framework.

#### Payload (Generic Assets)

- **`payload/skills`**: Instructions for agent phases.
- **`payload/workflows`**: Implementation of slash commands.
- **`payload/templates`**: Artifact and documentation templates.

### Existing Patterns

- The project follows a "DevOps Framework" mindset.
- Code is divided between `extension` (IDE specific) and `payload` (generic DevOps logic).
- High use of services and UI components in the extension.

### Dependencies

- AI Agents (Antigravity/Cursor) for task execution.
- VS Code API for the extension interface.

## Recommendation

- Systematically map `extension/src/services`, `extension/src/ui`, and `payload/`.
- Create a `SPEC.md` for each major subdirectory.
